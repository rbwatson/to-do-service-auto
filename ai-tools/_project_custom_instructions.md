This project is refactoring Python documentation testing tools.

Key conventions:
- "front matter" (two words in text), "front_matter" (in code)
- Use shared utilities from doc_test_utils.py
- CLI: --action [all|warning|error]
- Tests: test_data/ (pass) vs fail_data/ (fail)

Always follow standards in project knowledge.
