3. Read: PROJECT_CONVENTIONS.md (where it goes, CLI pattern)
4. Use: REFACTORING_CHECKLIST.md (follow step by step)
5. Read: TEST_STANDARDS.md (how to test it)
```

### Pattern 2: Refactoring Existing Tool

```text
1. Use: REFACTORING_CHECKLIST.md (complete guide)
2. Reference: CODE_STYLE_GUIDE.md (as you code)
3. Reference: TERMINOLOGY.md (correct terms)
4. Reference: TEST_STANDARDS.md (as you test)
5. Reference: PROJECT_CONVENTIONS.md (for consistency)
```

### Pattern 3: Adding Tests

```text
1. Read: TEST_STANDARDS.md (how to structure)
2. Read: TERMINOLOGY.md (correct terms)
3. Use: REFACTORING_CHECKLIST.md (testing section)
4. Reference: CODE_STYLE_GUIDE.md (code quality)
```

### Pattern 4: Bug Fix

```text
1. Use: REFACTORING_CHECKLIST.md (verification steps)
2. Read: TEST_STANDARDS.md (add regression test)
3. Reference: CODE_STYLE_GUIDE.md (maintain style)
4. Reference: TERMINOLOGY.md (if updating docs)
```

### Pattern 5: Documentation Update

```text
1. Read: TERMINOLOGY.md (correct terms)
2. Read: PROJECT_CONVENTIONS.md (documentation section)
3. Review existing docs for consistency
4. Update as needed
```

## For AI Assistants / Future Sessions

### Starting a New Session

Provide this context:

```text
I'm working on the documentation testing tools project. 
Please follow these standards:

- CODE_STYLE_GUIDE.md for coding conventions
- TEST_STANDARDS.md for testing
- TERMINOLOGY.md for correct term usage
- PROJECT_CONVENTIONS.md for structure and patterns
- REFACTORING_CHECKLIST.md for completeness

Key conventions:
- "front matter" (two words in text, front_matter in code)
- Use shared doc_test_utils functions
- CLI pattern: --action [all|warning|error]
- Test organization: test_data/ (pass) vs fail_data/ (fail)
- Logging: log(message, level, file, line, use_actions, action_level)
```

### For Specific Tasks

**Migrating a tool:**

```text
Migrate [tool-name] following REFACTORING_CHECKLIST.md.
Use CODE_STYLE_GUIDE.md and TERMINOLOGY.md for conventions.
```

**Adding tests:**

```text
Add tests for [feature] following TEST_STANDARDS.md.
Place valid files in test_data/, invalid in fail_data/.
```

**Bug fix:**

```text
Fix [bug] and add regression test per TEST_STANDARDS.md.
Verify with REFACTORING_CHECKLIST.md.
```

## Document Relationships

```text
TERMINOLOGY.md
    ↓ (defines terms used in)
CODE_STYLE_GUIDE.md
    ↓ (provides patterns for)
PROJECT_CONVENTIONS.md
    ↓ (guides structure for)
REFACTORING_CHECKLIST.md
    ↑ (references all above)
    ↓ (includes steps for)
TEST_STANDARDS.md
```

**Legend:**

- **TERMINOLOGY.md** is foundational - defines what words mean
- **CODE_STYLE_GUIDE.md** builds on terminology with coding rules
- **PROJECT_CONVENTIONS.md** applies style to project structure
- **REFACTORING_CHECKLIST.md** ties everything together procedurally
- **TEST_STANDARDS.md** is parallel to code standards, for testing

## Quick Reference

| Need to... | Read... |
| ------------ | --------- |
| Know correct term | TERMINOLOGY.md |
| Write Python code | CODE_STYLE_GUIDE.md |
| Organize files | PROJECT_CONVENTIONS.md |
| Write tests | TEST_STANDARDS.md |
| Complete task | REFACTORING_CHECKLIST.md |
| Design CLI | PROJECT_CONVENTIONS.md (CLI section) |
| Handle errors | CODE_STYLE_GUIDE.md (Error Handling) |
| Log messages | PROJECT_CONVENTIONS.md (Logging) |

| Use shared code | PROJECT_CONVENTIONS.md (Shared Utilities) |

---

## Success Criteria

You're following the standards well if:

✅ Code follows naming conventions consistently
✅ Tests exist for all functionality
✅ Documentation is complete and accurate
✅ Terms are used correctly
✅ Files are organized properly
✅ Error handling is graceful
✅ Logging uses correct levels
✅ CLI follows standard patterns
✅ Checklist items are completed
✅ Changes are verified before committing

---

## Remember

> **Consistency matters more than perfection.**

It's better to follow an imperfect standard consistently than to have perfect but
inconsistent code. When in doubt, check existing code and follow established patterns.

If you find a better way, great! Update the standards and refactor consistently.
