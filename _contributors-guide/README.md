# Contributor's guide to the To-Do Service

Welcome to the To-Do Service.
Your contributions are welcome.
There's not much code to contribute, but there is a lot of room to improve
the documentation.

If you'd like to contribute an improvement to the documentation, please review
the information in this page first.

You are also welcome to just jump into creating new topics and pull requests.
But, this is likely to return stern warnings about breaking some rules.
That's certainly one way that you can learn and improve, but most messages just send you back
to one of the references in this section.

Perhaps that's why you're here?

Whatever path that brought you here, here you are and you are welcome. Enjoy your visit.

## Start here

- [configure your system](../README.md#configure-your-system) correctly.
    This makes it easier to create a documentation update that works with the existing content.

    It's possible to make minor edits in the GitHub web site without installing the required software,
    **but this isn't recommended**.
    Such changes must be minor and, if you make a mistake, you must start over.

    **For the best contributor experience, install the required software and configure it correctly.**
- Review the [Writer's guide](./writers-guide.md).
    This tells you about what your documentation update should look like.

    The [Documentation requirements](./documentation-requirements.md) describes this in greater detail
    and identifies the errors returned by the automated testing.
    The [Validation errors](./validation-errors-table.md) describes the errors in more detail.
    Most of the errors also have links to documentation about
    how to resolve errors found by the automated testing.
